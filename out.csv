11934,8g70j0qw,COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence,10.18332/tid/119324,covid19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide12 as of 18 march 2020 a total number of 194909 cases of covid19 have been reported including 7876 deaths the majority of which have been reported in china 3242 and italy 25053 however as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors4 smoking to date has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases5 smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases6 previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than nonsmokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous merscov outbreak78 given the gap in the evidence we conducted a systematic review of studies on covid19 that included information on patients smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and covid19 outcomes including the severity of the disease the need for mechanical ventilation the need for intensive care unit icu hospitalization and death the literature search was conducted on 17 march 2020 using two databases pubmed sciencedirect with the search terms smoking or tobacco or risk factors or smoker and covid19 or covid 19 or novel coronavirus or sars cov2 or sars cov 2 and included studies published in 2019 and 2020 further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in english and referred to humans we also searched the reference lists of the studies included a total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search of which 66 were excluded after fulltext screening leaving five studies that were included all of the studies were conducted in china four in wuhan and one across provinces in mainland china the populations in all studies were patients with covid19 and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients with regard to the study design retrospective and prospective methods were used and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the covid19 pandemic december 2019 january 2020 specifically zhou et al9 studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with covid19 without however reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease among the 191 patients there were 54 deaths while 137 survived among those that died 9 were current smokers compared to 4 among those that survived with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and nonsurvivors p021 with regard to mortality from covid19 similarly zhang et al10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with covid19 the results showed that among severe patients n58 34 were current smokers and 69 were former smokers in contrast to nonsevere patients n82 among which 0 were current smokers and 37 were former smokers  leading to an or of 223 95 ci 065763 p02 huang et al11 studied the epidemiological characteristics of covid19 among 41 patients in this study none of those who needed to be admitted to an icu n13 was a current smoker in contrast three patients from the nonicu group were current smokers with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients p031 albeit the small sample size of the study the largest study population of 1099 patients with covid19 was provided by guan et al12 from multiple regions of mainland china descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients of which 173 had severe symptoms and 926 had nonsevere symptoms among the patients with severe symptoms 169 were current smokers and 52 were former smokers in contrast to patients with nonsevere symptoms where 118 were current smokers and 13 were former smokers additionally in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation admission to an icu or died 255 were current smokers and 76 were former smokers in contrast in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes only 118 were current smokers and 16 were former smokers no statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study finally liu et al13 found among their population of 78 patients with covid19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking 273 than the group that showed improvement or stabilization 30 with this difference statistically significant at the p0018 level in their multivariate logistic regression analysis the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression or1428 95 ci 1582500 p 0018 we identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with covid19 notably in the largest study that assessed severity there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed icu support mechanical ventilation or who had died and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases12 however from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 14 times more likely rr14 95 ci 098200 to have severe symptoms of covid19 and approximately 24 times more likely to be admitted to an icu need mechanical ventilation or die compared to nonsmokers rr24 95 ci 143404 in conclusion although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases with the limited available data and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of covid19,2020-03-20,Tob Induc

epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the second world war this article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the sarscov epidemy in france methods authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in france results we identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic 1 medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies diabetes obesity etc which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid19 2 age the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus 3 cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4 psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization andor socioeconomic difficulties furthermore the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational material and human resources in addition a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable many beds are closed wards have a high density of patients mental health community facilities are closed medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases we could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units to maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation several directions can be considered in particular with the creation of covid  units these units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist  infectious disease specialist all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days the nurse staff should benefit from specific training from daily medical checkups and from close psychological support family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference at the end of hospitalization in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations specific casemanagement should be organized with the possibility of home visits in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders the total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular followup is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement maintenance of sleep regularity physical exercise social interactions stress management and coping strategies prevention of addictions etc they should also be trained to prevent detect and treat early warning symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder because their prevalence was high in the regions of china most affected by the pandemic discussion french mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for

sarscov2 was experienced in madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by march 29th methods since the beginning of the epidemics the occupational health and safety service ohss organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection for molecular diagnosis of sarscov2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the microbiology laboratory by automatized specific pcr methods that was operative from february 25th as part of the preparedness results from a total of 6800 employees of the hospital 2085 306  were tested during the period 129 march 2020 some of them repeatedly 2286 total samples the first hcw infected was confirmed on march 9th a total of 791 hcw and personnel were confirmed to be infected by march 29th representing 38 of those tested and 116  of all the hospital workers the proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between hcw and those patients attending at the emergency department er during the same period and adjusted by the same age range there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of sarscov2 positive pcr detection between hcw from high risk areas involved in close contact with covid19 patients in comparison with clerical administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients the curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and hcw during march 2020 showed an almost parallel shape discussion the recommendation from our ohss did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore a high proportion of hcw and nonsanitary personnel was tested in march 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in madrid accounting for a total of 306  of the hospital employees most of the covid19 cases among the hospital hcw and personnel were mild and managed at home under selfisolation measures however 23 3 required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the icu no fatalities occurred during the study period although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from covid19 patients to hcws mainly at the first phase of the epidemics there were no significant differences on the infection rates of hcw and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk furthermore the evolution of cases during the same time period march 2020 between patients attending the er and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics this experience is similar to the communicated from wuhan verified by the who joint mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the netherlands where most of the infections of hcw were related to household or community contacts significance since the collective of hospital hcw are exhaustively screened in specific centers their rate of infection for sarscov2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community there appears to be a close connection between hcw infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by sarscov2 due to the fact of the hospital environment the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection as compared with the community are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk exhaustive testing such as the one carried out in our institution covering over one third of all the workers could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community since a significant proportion of covid19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested it is highly likely that this 116  is a minimum estimation of the impact of sarscov2 circulation in madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics this is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels this has important implications to more precisely estimate

opportunity to learn a bit more about the novel coronavirus 2019ncov raging in that city to avoid domestic spread of the virus japanese officials screened every passenger for disease symptoms and tested them for the virus after they landed eight tested positive but four of those had no symptoms at all says epidemiologist hiroshi nishiura of hokkaido university sapporowhich is a bright red flag for epidemiologists who are trying to figure out what the fastmoving epidemic has in store for humanity if many infections go unnoticed as the japanese finding suggests that vastly complicates efforts to contain the outbreak two months after 2019ncov emergedand with well over 20000 cases and 427 deaths as science went to pressmathematical modelers have been racing to predict where the virus will move next how big a toll it might ultimately take and whether isolating patients and limiting travel will slow it but to make confident predictions they need to know much more about how easily the virus spreads how sick it makes people and whether infected people with no symptoms can still infect others some of that information is coming out of china but amid the allout battle to control the virus and with diagnostic capabilities in short supply chinese researchers cannot answer all the questions countries with just a handful of cases such as japan can also reveal important data says preben aavitsland of the norwegian institute of public health its up to all countries now that receive cases to collect as much information as possible with the limited information so far scientists are sketching out possible paths that the virus might take weighing the likelihoods of each and trying to determine the fallout were at this stage where defined scenarios and the evidence for and against them are really important because it allows people to plan better says marc lipsitch an epidemiologist at the harvard th chan school of public health these scenarios break into two broad categories the world gets the virus under controlor it doesnt the most optimistic scenario is one in which 2019ncov remains mostly confined to china where 99 of the confirmed cases have occurred so far by 4 february two dozen other countries had together reported 195 cases there has obviously been a huge amount of spread within china but elsewhere theres no evidence of any kind of substantial humantohuman transmission says robin thompson a mathematical epidemiologist at the university of oxford the risk probably isnt as high as some models have been projecting if no other countries see sustained transmission and the quarantines and other measures taken in china start to reduce the number of infections there the risk of spread might gradually go down and the virus might eventually be quashed this happened with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 which ended after fewer than 9000 cases thats what the world health organization who which last week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern hopes for this time in a press conference directorgeneral tedros adhanom ghebreyesus called for a global version of the approach his team took in the current ebola outbreak fight the disease at the source and try to keep it from gaining a foothold elsewhere focus on the epicenter tedros said if you have several epicenters it is chaos epidemiologist marion koopmans of erasmus medical center says it may not be that hard to contain the virus in a new locale as long as the first cases are detected and isolated earlyprovided the virus is not highly transmissible we dont see it taking off in the 200 or so cases seeded outside of china koopmans says if that pattern holds there still is the possibility it will bend off she and others suspect the climate may help influenza typically only spreads during the winter months and hits northern and southern china at different times if that is true for 2019ncov its spread might start to slow down in the northern hemisphere within a few months that is a big question mark were trying to assess at the moment says joseph wu a modeler at the university of hong kong but is containment realistic success will depend in part on whether infected people who dont have symptoms can spread the virus asymptomatic people are hard to find and isolate so if they can spread disease 2019ncov will be very difficult to stop in china says alessandro vespignani a modeler of infectious diseases at northeastern university but if asymptomatic transmission is rare he says isolation and social distancing can have a big impact so far it has been difficult to get a handle on this question some data from china seem to support asymptomatic transmission but none are clearcut a widely reported 30 january letter in the new england journal of medicine described the case of a chinese businesswoman who touched off a cluster of four cases in germany before she became sick herself but 4 days later it became clear the researchers had not contacted the woman who had flown back to china before the paper was published in a later phone interview she said she had experienced some symptoms while in germany in followup results announced in a 4 february press release the researchers noted that some patients they studied shed virus even though their symptoms were mild thats almost as bad as asymptomatic transmission says virologist christian drosten of the charitÌ© university hospital in berlin patients with mild symptoms are unlikely to seek medical care and may not even stay home giving the virus ample opportunities to spread far and wide based on what they have seen so far many researchers think its probably too late to contain the virus as the virus continues to spread in china the risk of exportation to other countries grows and sooner or later we will see it spread in another country aavitsland says so far there has been no sustained transmission outside of china but lipsitch expects that to change i would be really shocked if in 2 or 3 weeks there wasnt ongoing transmission with hundreds of cases in several countries on several continents if the virus does spread to all corners of the world in a pandemic several questions will loom large what percentage of the population will become infected and of those how many will get very sick or die more severe cases place heavier demands on health care systemshospitals in wuhan are already overwhelmedand result in greater fears and disruption of daily life a deadly pandemic might force the world to make stark choices about fair access to medicines or vaccines if they become available it might also lead to widespread restrictions on domestic travel akin to those already in force in china aavitsland says if on the other hand 2019ncov resembles the common cold or a mild flu the spread of the virus would be less alarming existing travel bans likely would be lifted understanding the severity and case fatality rate is a challenge with any new pathogen when a new influenza strain emerged in 2009and went on to cause a pandemicmany worried it might turn out to be a nasty variety it took months to establish that the new virus killed only about one in 10000 patients so far mortality among known 2019ncov cases is about 2 and some reports say 20 of infected people suffer severe disease but these figures may overlook tens of thousands of people with mild diseasesay a sore throat or a lowgrade feverwho never seek medical care and may not even know they were infected with 2019ncov many may have no symptoms at all so what looks like a horrific disease may be the horrific tip of a very large iceberg lipsitch says the fact that four japanese evacuees were asymptomatic is a case in point studies in china have also reported some cases with few or no symptoms whats missing is a large study in china lipsitch says he suggests some fraction of the tests that are available in a place with many cases should be set aside for that purpose current recommendations in china call for testing people with clear symptoms only if indeed 2019ncov becomes pandemic humanity may be stuck with it indefinitely after spreading far and wide the virus might become endemic in the human population just like four other coronaviruses that cause the common cold and occasionally cause fresh outbreaks how much death and disease it would cause is anyones guess the silver lining of the epidemic is that scientists have collected and shared information at record speed every day that goes by we know
